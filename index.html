        <h2>About Gol D. Roger</h2>
        <p>
            Gol D. Roger is the greatest pirate of all time. He found the biggest treasure before handing himself to
            the Marine. He went down by leaving the following message:<br>
            "My treasure, you can have it if you want it. Find it. I left it somewhere in this world !"<br>
            After such a statement started a new Era: the search of the "One Piece".
